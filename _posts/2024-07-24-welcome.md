Hello everyone! Welcome to my site 👋🏻

I am Nikolai Emil Damm AKA Devantler. I am a software engineer with a strong passion for open-source, and I believe that working transparently and collaboratively is the best way to create high-quality software. I have been working in the software industry for 6 years, and I have experience in a wide range of technologies and domains.

I created this site to share my learnings and experiences with the broader community. I will be writing about software development, open-source, cloud computing, and other topics that I find interesting. I hope that you find my posts useful and informative, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions that you may have. You can leave a comment in the comment section for a post, or reach me anonymously through the contact form on [contact me](/contact).

Peace ✌🏻
