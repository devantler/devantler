```csharp
public class Profile {
  public string Name { get; init; } = "Nikolai Emil Damm";
  public string Alias { get; set; } = "devantler";
  public string Job { get; set;} = "Digitalisation at Energinet";
  public string Education { get; set; } = "MSc in Software Engineering";
  public FavLang FavLang { get; set; } = FavLang.CSharp;
  public string[] Skills { get; set; } = { "C#/.NET", "K8s", "Docker" };
  public string[] Interests { get; set; } = { "Running", "Gaming", "Technology" };
}
```

- 🌱 I'm currently exploring k8s and migrating my homelab to dev, staging and prod cluster environments with GitOps (FluxCD). The aim is to have a setup that is replicable, highly available, and promotable, such that changes deployed to a dev environment can be promoted to production. The end result should rely on the smart use of CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- 🔭 I'm currently working in Digitalisation at Energinet.
- 💬 Ask me about anything. I love to meet new people and discuss technologies, interests and knowledge.
