### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=devantler)

My name is Nikolai Emil Damm. I am currently studying my MSc at University of Southern Denmark, and working as a student developer at FiftyTwo.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a distributed Docker Swarm cluster running on 3 RPis for learning purposes and for hosting personal projects. I plan to migrate the cluster to Nomad in the near future.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about programming of IoT devices, hardware, timed automata, and creating domain specific languages with xText.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an open-source round-trip engineering service, capable of syncing source and target text-files like PlantUML and C#, to enable UML-based programming and immediate documentation of written code.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help to find good resources for learning Kubernetes, especially the basics and best-practices when developing workloads with Helm charts. I am also looking for resources on developing a modern data-lake and data standardization, when working with large amounts of data.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. I love to meet new people, and discuss technologies, interests and knowledge.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolai-emil-damm-14a786150/) or send me an email on < hassium-delta.07@icloud.com>
- âš¡ Fun fact: There is a danish saying "There are owls in the mud" which means something suspicious is going on.
