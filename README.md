My name is Nikolai Emil Damm. I am currently studying for my MSc at the University of Southern Denmark and working as a student developer at Umbraco. 

- 🌱 I'm currently researching dataspaces as part of my master thesis - _Exploration of state-of-the-art technology, architectures and tools to create future-proof dataspaces_.
- 🔭 I'm currently working on Umbraco Heartcore, the proprietary headless CMS solution by Umbraco.
- 💬 Ask me about anything. I love to meet new people and discuss technologies, interests and knowledge.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolai-emil-damm-14a786150/) or send me an email on <mojo_caring0k@icloud.com>
- ⚡ Fun fact: There is a danish saying, "There are owls in the mud", which means something suspicious is going on.
