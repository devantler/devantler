As a software engineer, I have a strong passion for modern software development practices and technologies. I truly believe in the power of open-source software, especially its ability to spark innovation and encourage collaboration. I'm a big fan of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and appreciate their work in promoting the use of cloud-native technologies. I believe that by working together on important software, we can tackle the challenges we face today and in the future.

## Occupation 💼

Years of experience in software development have given me a solid foundation in modern software development practices and technologies. I have worked on a wide range of projects, from developing and maintaining e-commerce platforms to creating and operating cloud-native solutions. I have a strong passion for learning and sharing knowledge, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a software engineer. I have a sharp eye for detail and a strong focus on quality and simplicity in everything I do. I love working with people who share my passion for software development and who are not afraid to challenge the status quo.
